## Axiom Referrals

Axiom Referrals allows any smart contract developer to incentivize frontends to drive users or volume to their already deployed contract. The `AxiomReferral` contract allows registration of user addresses for association with referrers and trustless claiming of referral rewards, verified in ZK. Each referee must register their referrer using the `setReferrer` function in `AxiomReferral`. After this, the referrer can claim rewards by sending a query to Axiom which proves the total on-chain value generated by their referred users.

Axiom Referrals uses the [AxiomIncentives](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/axiom-incentives) system built using [Axiom](https://axiom.xyz), which allows rewarding users based on ZK-proven on-chain activity.
